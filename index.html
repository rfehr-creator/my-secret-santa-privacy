  <h1>Privacy Policy for Secret Santa App</h1>

  <p>This app collects participant names solely for organizing Secret Santa events. Names are used to randomly assign gift recipients and to display the list of participants within each event.</p>

  <p>Names are stored in a secure database and are the only personal details retained. No other personal information is collected.</p>

  <p>Users can remove their data at any time by deleting the event they created or participated in. This action permanently removes their name and associated data from the database.</p>

  <p>User data is never shared with third parties. The app does not use analytics, advertising, or external data services.</p>

  <p>If you have questions or concerns, please contact rfk4plt@gmail.com.</p>
