# Privacy Policy for Secret Santa App

This app collects participant names solely for organizing Secret Santa events. Names are used to randomly assign gift recipients and to display the list of participants within each event.

Names are stored in a secure database and are the only personal details retained. No other personal information is collected.

Users can remove their data at any time by deleting the event they created or participated in. This action permanently removes their name and associated data from the database.

User data is never shared with third parties. The app does not use analytics, advertising, or external data services.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact rfk4plt@gmail.com.
